    <h1>Seasons</h1>
    <h2>Spring</h2>
    <p>Spring is the season of renewal and growth. After the long, cold winter, nature wakes up with fresh energy.
         Trees begin to grow new leaves, flowers start blooming, and the air is filled with the songs of birds.
         The weather becomes warmer and more pleasant, making it a perfect time to enjoy outdoor activities.</p>
        <p>It is also a season that brings happiness and positivity. Farmers sow new crops, families spend time in parks,
             and colorful festivals are celebrated around the world. Spring reminds us of hope, fresh beginnings, and the 
            beauty of life.</p>
            <p>During spring, daylight hours gradually become longer, which lifts people’s moods and encourages more time outside.
                 Children enjoy playing in gardens, people go on walks, and the world feels alive with energy. The gentle breezes and 
                 occasional showers of rain make the air fresh and soothing.</p>
                 <p>Spring also holds deep symbolic meaning. Many poets and writers describe it as a time 
                    of love, youth, and inspiration. Just as plants bloom again, people also feel motivated 
                    to start new projects or set fresh goals. It is a season that connects the beauty of nature 
                    with human emotions.</p>

            <h2>Summer</h2>
            <p>Summer is the hottest season of the year, marked by long days full of bright sunshine. 
                Schools usually close for summer vacations, and children eagerly enjoy their free time 
                playing outdoors, swimming, or traveling with their families. The warmth of summer encourages 
                people to spend more time outside, whether at the beach, in parks, or exploring nature.</p>
                <p>It is also the season of delicious fruits like mangoes, watermelons, and peaches, which help 
                    keep the body cool. Cold drinks, ice cream, and refreshing juices are enjoyed by people of all ages.
                     Farmers harvest crops like wheat and prepare their fields for new plantings, making summer an important 
                     season for agriculture.</p>
